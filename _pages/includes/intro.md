I am a lecturer at Northeast Forestry University in Harbin. 

My research interests include real-time systems, real-time scheduling theory, and embedded systems. Currently, I am focusing on research related to probabilistic scheduling. If you are interested in academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at [fei.guan@nefu.edu.cn](mailto:fei.guan@nefu.edu.cn).
